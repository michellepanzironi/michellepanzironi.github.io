									<h2>üí¨ More Praise From My Colleagues</h2>
								</header>

								<p>Definitely a standout developer in terms of her desire to take on challenges, her ability to talk to people, and her charisma & enthusiasm, and always enjoyed our discussions. Outside of development, she took on the big task of managing our entire engineering departments Lunch & Learn. One of the things that's not always easy, is finding developers (from junior to lead) who are positive, who can learn from and mesh well with their teammates, who want to know what they can do better, and who are willing to go outside their comfort zone. <br /> If that's who you are looking for, look no further than Michelle.</p>

								<p>Michelle started her tenure in CB Insights as a Test Engineer in our team. With determination and hard work she was promoted to a Software Engineer role. She became a solid contributor to the team mostly working with our large React code base. On the side, she ran technical lunch and learns with the objective of sharing knowledge within the engineering department. Above all, Michelle's an excellent, positive, and energetic person.</p>
